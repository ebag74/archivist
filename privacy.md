# Privacy Policy

This application does not collect, store, or share any personal information.  
All data remains local to the user’s device except where required to connect to external services (e.g., TikTok’s API) for posting content.

No analytics, tracking, or third-party data collection is performed.  
Any tokens or credentials are stored and controlled by the user.

Because this tool is for personal use only, no external users or personal data are involved.
